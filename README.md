# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Project

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using a Node.js/Express backend and a React frontend. Users can set up MFA and then use it to verify their identity during login.

## Features

*   **MFA Setup:** Users can initiate the setup of MFA for their account.
*   **QR Code Generation:** During setup, a QR code is generated and displayed, allowing users to scan it with an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy).
*   **Token Verification:** Users can enter a one-time token generated by their authenticator app to verify their identity.
*   **Password login**: Users can enter a password to login.
*   **Frontend**: the app has a simple but effective react frontend.

## Technologies Used

*   **Backend:**
    *   Node.js
    *   Express.js (web framework)
    *   `qrcode-terminal` (QR code generation in the terminal for development)
    *   `speakeasy` (TOTP generation and verification)
    *   `body-parser` (middleware for parsing request bodies)
    *   `cors` (middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
    * `nodemon` (for development)
*   **Frontend:**
    *   React.js (JavaScript library for building user interfaces)
    *   Vite (build tool)
    * tailwind css (for styling)
